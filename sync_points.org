#+TITLE: Sync points

** https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.13/manual/sync_points.html
** A synchronization point (sync point) is a point in program execution that waits for the completion of all jobs that have been scheduled so far. Sync points limit your ability to use all worker threads available in the job system for a period of time. As such, you should generally aim to avoid sync points.
